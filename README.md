## Contents of this Repository

- [instances](instances): sample scripts that may be used as input files for [YesWorkflow](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/yw-prototypes) and [noWorkflow](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/noworkflow); explanations of the scripts are provided in the thesis
- [noworkflow_outputs](noworkflow_outputs): exemplary outputs generated by the modified version of [noWorkflow](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/noworkflow); they are available in different file formats
- [queries](queries): example queries that are used by the [SPARQL Playground](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/sparql-playground) for retrieving information from exported provenance data
- [sample_data](sample_data): turtle files that may be used as input for the [SPARQL Playground](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/sparql-playground)
- [yesworkflow_outputs](yesworkflow_outputs): exemplary outputs generated by the modified version of [YesWorkflow](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/yw-prototypes); they are available in different file formats
